This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=442

A mixture of navajo-night.vim and xian.vim (my previous post, too *pastel*).
No support for cterm (GUI only).

Tested on:
 * LCD (advisable Contrast & Brightness @ ~25%)
 * CRT (advisable Contrast & Brightness @ ~75%)

Aims at:
 * minimized colors allocation (12 colors only )
 * reduced eye impact and save energy (no #FF, #F0 is the max authorized)
 * better looking folding and diff mode than xian.vim (tastes may vary)
 * while keeping most good looking colors from navajo-night (mostly the bg is different)

Please feedback to christian_michon@yahoo.fr for color tweaking and suggestions for
enhancements.

Thanks to the authors of navajo-night.vim and Shantonu for his background color ;)
